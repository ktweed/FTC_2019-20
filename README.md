### TeleOp1.java
TeleOp1 is the main TeleOp for the SKYSTONE competition. It includes:
- Tank-style driving controls
- Control of Device Interface and built-in LEDs
- Color sensing (Press X on gamepad1)
- Automatic braking lights
- Manually toggleable turn signals

Currently, TeleOp1 is designed to use a single gamepad, with all controls being placed on it. It may be expanded to use a second gamepad to control an element that interacts with the game elements.
