# Engineering Notebook - January 8th
### Members Present:
Amog, Aron, Keith

### Objectives:
Begin writing autonomous period code

### Completed Tasks:
We modified the pushbot with encoder autonomous example to work with our hardwaremap

### Reflections
Currently it is only rear wheel drive, so we will implement the front wheels next class.

### Details, Diagrams, and Images
Pushbot uses a robot object, so instead we removed the robot references and initialized our hardware manually.
