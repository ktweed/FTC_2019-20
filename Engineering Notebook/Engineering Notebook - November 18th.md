# Engineering Notebook - November 18th
### Members Present:
Aron, Amog, Keith

### Objectives:
Finish connecting the control modules, and ensure that the wires are kept tidy.

### Completed Tasks:
All of the motors are now connected to the controllers, and the controllers are all connected to the core power distribution module. We also attached the main power switch.

### Reflections
Since we have a similar build in terms of motors to last year's robot, we should be able to easily adapt the code we used last year to work for this year's robot.

We had to cut off part of the casing of the DC motor controller, since the encoder wires wouldn't fit.
