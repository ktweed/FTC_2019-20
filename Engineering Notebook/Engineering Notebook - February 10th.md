# Engineering Notebook - February 10th
### Members Present:
Amog, Aron, Keith

### Objectives:
Reflect on the competition and determine how we should improve our robot for the next competiton

### Completed Tasks:
Research legality of breadboards for competition
Determine how to grip the blocks
Practice

### Reflections
We determined that breadboards are not competition legal, or at the very least they are a very grey area. To avoid it, we will solder the wires next class.
The other classes will work on continuing their gripper mechanism.
