# Engineering Notebook - December 17th

### Members Present:
Aron, Amog, Keith

### Objectives:
Try to fix the issues with the arm mechanism

### Completed Tasks:
We were unsuccessful in our tests today to fix the arm, but we added a second passive arm to try to asssist in stability.

### Reflections
There are still issues with the arm balance, even with the speed severely reduced. Even abruptly stopping can unbalance the arm and cause it to whip back and forth. Simple direct DC control may work better, or, alternatively, using a gear reduction to make the arm move at a slower, more controlled pace are possible solutions. If these do not work, we will hope that the scissor lift team has a functional design. We also added a second passive arm to assist in holding up the grabbing mechanism.
