# Engineering Notebook - November 5th
### Members Present:
Amog, Aron, Keith

### Objectives:
Design a chassis that will be able to fulfill the needs of our robot

### Completed Tasks:
Designed a chassis that will be able to contain all of the components, and fit within the size restrictions.

### Reflections
The 18"x18"x18" size restriction doesn't seem like it will pose a problem later, since we don't need a ton for our chassis to hold.

### Details, Diagrams, and Images

This is the design that we proposed, with a second layer for sensors and a lower layer for interacting with the game elements.
