# Engineering Notebook - January 14th
### Members Present:
Aron, Keith

### Objectives:
Troubleshoot our motor controller issues

### Completed Tasks:
We were not able to complete our objective today.

### Reflections
No matter how we hook it up, the third motor controller is always disconnected once we start the robot. We tried many different cables and motor controllers. Next class we will try changing out the main distribution module.
