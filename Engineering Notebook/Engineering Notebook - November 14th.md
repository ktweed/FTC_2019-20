# Engineering Notebook - November 14th
---
### Members Present:
Aron, Amog, Keith

### Objectives:
Attach the motor controllers and core power distribution module, and manage the wires so they won't interfere with other components of the robot in motion.

### Completed Tasks:
We attached the motor controllers to the top layer of the chassis, and attached the core power distribution module to the front of the raised layer. All the wires are held in place with velcro ties.

### Reflections
We designed a battery holder that allows us to easily remove and reattach the battery. It has 2 large velcro strips held to the chassis by a metal plate, so we can wrap the velcro around the battery to hold it in place.
