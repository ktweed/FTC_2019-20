# Engineering Notebook - January 10th
### Members Present:
Amog, Aron, Keith

### Objectives:
Add the front wheels to our autonomous period code

### Completed Tasks:
The pushbot code now drives all four wheels, and we can input distances and have the robot move along a set path.

### Reflections
The code all seemed to work properly, but our robot keeps dropping the motor controller. We will try to troubleshoot this next class.

### Details, Diagrams, and Images
