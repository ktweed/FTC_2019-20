# Engineering Notebook - February 6th
### Members Present:
Amog, Aron, Keith

### Objectives:
Prepare for the upcoming competition.

### Completed Tasks:
- Polished up engineering notebook
- Pack up any materials, spare parts, and/or cables that we will need to bring to the competition.
- Attempted to finish autonomous code, but decided on instead using a simple program with a much higher chance of success.

### Reflections
Our robot isn't fully complete, but this will be a good trial to see if what we've decided to pursue is effective and worthwhile.
