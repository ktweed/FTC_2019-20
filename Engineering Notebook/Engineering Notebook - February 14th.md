# Engineering Notebook - February 14
### Members Present:
Amog, Aron, Keith

### Objectives:
Write code for the other team's gripping mechanism and test it out

### Completed Tasks:
The other team's gripping mechanism is now functional. 

### Reflections
It seems like it may be a little rough on the metal and will require a bit more grip, but it does function.

### Details, Diagrams, and Images
The mechanism the other team built is fairly simple. It takes a piece of paracord attached to both halves of the block manipulator we previously created, and uses a DC motor to tighten it, in order to make the sides of the block manipulator squeeze the blocks.
