# Engineering Notebook - November 22nd
### Members Present:
Amog, Aron, Keith

### Objectives:
Modify last year's code to control our robot.

### Completed Tasks:
Our robot is now able to be remotely operated with the FTC robot controller app, and a Logitech generic controller.

### Reflections
We noticed that one of our rear wheels is loose, which ended up being an issue with our motor. We are unable to fix this, but the wobble seems minimal and unlikely to damage the robot further.
